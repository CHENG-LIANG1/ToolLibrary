# ToolLibrary

The project I developed is a community Tool Library System. The tool library lends tools to people in the community for free. 
There are two types of users in the tool system.
Staff and Member, staff has the administrator access to the tool library. 


## A Staff can perform the following operations:
1.	Add a new tool
2.	Add new pieces of an existing tool
3.	Remove some pieces of a tool
4.	Remove a member
5.	Find the contact number of a member
6.	Return to main menu

## A Member can perform the following operations:
1.	Display all the tools of a tool type
2.	Borrow a tool
3.	Return a tool
4.	List all the tools that the member is renting
5.	Display top three most frequently rented tools
6.	Return to main menu
